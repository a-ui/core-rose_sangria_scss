# Antwerp Core Branding - "Rose / Sangria edition"

This project contains a slightly modified version of Antwerp's digital styling kit. It is the starting point to style your app or website for the city of Antwerp. Next to the [Antwerp Branding Core](https://github.com/a-ui/core_branding_scss), there are a bunch of color variants, of which this version is one.
This uses primary-color: #E04E39 and secundary-color: #554741.
